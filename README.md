# First Person Setup

Unity Personal Setup with functionalities and packages with the basics to start or test mechanics in a 3D first-person environment.

This setup features standard movement and functions from general first-person concept in a modular and easily scalable way. The functions can be adapted to different types of game themes.

## Mechanics and Features

### Input System
Using the Unity Input System package, I created a separate controller for Player Inputs, making the project easier to scale.
It is also possible in this project to easily switch the Inputs for each type of action.

### Movement and Orientation
Fluid camera movement and rotation controller.
Jump and speed control system with events for easy understanding by other controllers if necessary.
Use of the Unity Cinemachine package for better camera control.

### Interaction
Player interaction controller with colliders and interaction listening system. This system makes it easy to interact with any object in the scene.
Use of the QuickOutline Plugin to easily highlight interactable objects for better interaction with the environment.

### State Machine
Simple state controller for easy manipulation, creation and testing of new states and behaviors of enemies, objects or systems.

### Life Controller
Life controller and damage components for easy manipulation and testing of characters.

### Other Features
Services and utilities for better manipulation of variables and classes.
Use of the Unity ProBuilder package to create scenarios and geometric shapes for use as placeholders.
